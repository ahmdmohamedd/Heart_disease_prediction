# Heart_disease_prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction System uses a Decision Tree algorithm to predict heart disease risk based on health data. Trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset, it processes features like age, sex, and cholesterol levels. The program provides model evaluation metrics and visualizations, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using a Decision Tree algorithm. The model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains various features related to patient health.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can save lives. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can help identify individuals at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

## Dataset

The model is built using the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) and can be found [here](https://github.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). The dataset contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, including:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Angina
- Oldpeak
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia
- Target (presence of heart disease)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
